			"whatIsSynthetix": {
				"title": "What is Synthetix?",
				"description": "Synthetix is a decentralised synthetic asset issuance protocol built on Ethereum. These synthetic assets (Synths) are created by staking the Synthetix Network Token (SNX), and these Synths can be exchanged for each other directly with the Synthetix smart contracts on Kwenta.io."
			},
			"whyStakeSnx": {
				"title": "Why stake SNX?",
				"description": "SNX stakers receive two kinds of rewards. Firstly, they receive SNX staking rewards, which are created through the inflationary monetary policy.  Secondly, there’s Synth exchange rewards, which are generated by Synth trades on Kwenta.io."
			},
			"howStakeSnx": {
				"title": "What do SNX stakers need to do?",
				"description": "All Synths need to be backed by staked SNX at a Collateralisation Ratio of 750%. SNX stakers need to manage their own ratio to be above this figure, which they can do by burning Synths to increase their ratio or minting Synths to reduce it. If they do this, they can collect weekly rewards."
			},
			"risks": {
				"title": "What are the risks?",
				"description": "All SNX stakers create a ‘debt’ when they stake. Their debt begins as the amount of sUSD they initially mint, and fluctuates according to gains or losses made by other Synth holders. Any time anyone holds a Synth that appreciates in value, that gain is distributed proportionally between all the staked SNX holders’ debts. A staker must pay off their debt before they can unlock their staked SNX."
